   b. Not disclose the Software or any information derived therefrom to
      any unauthorized person or entity;

   c. Apply no less than the same degree of care to protect the
      confidentiality of the Software as they apply to their own
      confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable
      care;

   d. Immediately notify Costco of any unauthorized access, use, or
      disclosure of the Software;

   e. Not disclose, discuss, or share any business logic, forecasting
      methodologies, demand planning strategies, D&D thresholds, or

      with any unauthorized person or entity;

   f. Not capture, record, screenshot, or otherwise reproduce any
      data, analytics outputs, forecast values, or performance
      metrics displayed by the Software for distribution outside of
      authorized Costco business channels.

5. DATA AND SECURITY

   The Software is designed to interface with Costco's proprietary data
   systems, including but not limited to Databricks environments, Delta
   tables, Databricks SQL Warehouses, and internal forecasting and
   analytics pipelines. All data accessed, processed, or displayed by
   the Software is the exclusive property of Costco and is subject to
   Costco's data governance policies.

   a. No data accessed through the Software may be exported, copied, or
      transmitted outside of Costco's authorized systems without express
      written approval;

   b. All access credentials, connection strings, API keys, Databricks
      tokens, service account credentials, and environment variables
      used by the Software are confidential and must be stored and
      managed in accordance with Costco's information security policies;

   c. The Software operates in a read-only capacity against Costco's
      data systems. Any attempt to modify, write to, or alter the
      underlying data sources through the Software or through
      modification of the Software is strictly prohibited;

   d. All data displayed by the Software, including but not limited to
      historical sales volumes, weekly forecasts, backtesting results,
      D&D quantities, D&D financial impacts, and depot-level metrics,
      is proprietary Costco business data and is subject to the
      confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 4;

   e. The Software enforces row limits and query controls on all data
      access. Any attempt to circumvent, disable, or modify these
      controls is strictly prohibited;

   f. Any data exports generated by the Software (including but not
      limited to CSV downloads and exportable table views) are subject
      to the same confidentiality and data governance requirements as
      the source data and may only be used for authorized Costco
      internal business purposes.

6. AI AND ANALYTICS CONTROLS

   The Software contains an optional AI-assisted analytics component
   (the "Assistant") that is subject to the following additional terms:

   a. The Assistant is designed to operate deterministically. All
      numerical outputs, calculations, and analytics results are
      computed directly from stored data in Costco's Databricks
      tables. The Assistant does not generate, estimate, approximate,
      or hallucinate numerical values;

   b. When AI capabilities are enabled, AI is used solely for intent
      routing (interpreting user questions to select the appropriate
      pre-built deterministic query). AI does not generate SQL, does
      not perform calculations, and does not produce forecasts;

   c. AI capabilities may be disabled entirely via a single
      configuration flag. When disabled, the Assistant operates
      exclusively through deterministic, rule-based routing;

   d. No user query, input, or interaction with the Assistant may be
      transmitted to any external AI service, API, or third-party
      system without express written authorization from Costco and
      in compliance with Costco's data governance and privacy policies;

   e. The Assistant's guardrails, safety mechanisms, and scope
      limitations must not be modified, bypassed, or disabled without
      express written authorization from Costco;

   f. The Assistant does not generate forecasts, does not modify
      model logic, and does not write to any data source. Any
      modification of the Software that would alter these constraints
      is strictly prohibited.

7. DEPLOYMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE

   The Software is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Platform
   (GCP) Cloud Run or equivalent authorized Costco infrastructure.

   a. The Software may only be deployed on infrastructure authorized
      and approved by Costco's IT and security teams;

   b. All deployment configurations, Dockerfiles, service definitions,
      and infrastructure-as-code files included in the Software are
      proprietary and subject to all restrictions set forth herein;

   c. The Software must not be deployed in any environment that is
      accessible to unauthorized users or to the public internet
      without appropriate authentication and authorization controls
      approved by Costco;

   d. Any cloud resources, compute instances, or services provisioned
      for the operation of the Software must comply with Costco's
      cloud governance and cost management policies.

8. SCOPE OF SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY

   For the avoidance of doubt, the Software is designed and authorized
   to perform the following functions only:

   a. Display weekly demand forecast outputs generated by upstream
      Databricks pipelines;

   b. Provide drill-down forecast exploration by run date, depot,
      item, and forecast horizon;

   c. Display model backtesting and performance metrics including
      WAPE, bias, absolute error, and percent error;

   d. Monitor and display Dump & Destroy (D&D) trends, rates,
      quantities, and financial impacts at company and depot levels;

   e. Provide a guided analytics assistant that answers user questions
      using deterministic, auditable calculations;
